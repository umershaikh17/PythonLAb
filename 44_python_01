# PROBLEM 1 
# The population of a town is 198568. Out of them 45312 are men and 35678 are women. Find the number of children in the town.

#assigning varaibles for given data

total_population_of_the_town = 198568
population_of_men = 45312
population_of_women = 35678

#calculating the number of children in the town

population_of_children = (total_population_of_the_town - (population_of_men + population_of_women))

#output 

print(" The Number of children in the town are" , population_of_children)



# PROBLEM 2
# A shopkeeper has 2425 boxes of 24 pencils each. How many pencils do all the boxes have in all?

#assigning varaibles for the given data 

total_number_of_pencil_boxes = 2425
number_of_pencils_in_each_boxes = 24

#calculating the total number of pencil in all the boxes 

total_pencils_in_all_the_boxes = total_number_of_pencil_boxes * number_of_pencils_in_each_boxes

#output

print("total number of pencils in all the boxes" , total_pencils_in_all_the_boxes  )





# PROBLEM 3
#There are 86 rooms in a school. 4356 students study there. Equal number of students sits in each room.
# Find the number of students sitting in one room . 

#assigning varaibles for the given data 

total_number_of_rooms = 86
number_of_students = 4356

#calculating the total number of students sitting in one room 

number_of_students_sitting_in_one_room = number_of_students // total_number_of_rooms

#output 

print ("number of students sitting in one room " , number_of_students_sitting_in_one_room )





# PROBLEM 4 
# Maria bought 96 toys priced equally for $12960. The amount of $1015 is still left with her.
# Find the cost of each toy and the amount she had.

#assigning varaibles for the given data 

number_of_toys_brought_by_Maria = 96
Total_cost = 12960
amount_left = 1015

#calculating cost of each toy 

cost_of_each_toy = Total_cost // number_of_toys_brought_by_Maria 

print("cost of each toy" , cost_of_each_toy )

amount_she_had = (Total_cost + amount_left )

print("amount Maria had" , amount_she_had )
